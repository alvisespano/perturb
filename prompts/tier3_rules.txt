I'm interested in applying code transformation rules to small python programs.
I will provide you with multiple implementations of the same python function.
The first function is the reference version. The other functions are unoptimized via some code perturbations.
Below I am giving you some formal rewriting rules that you can apply to transform the perturbed code and get to the optimized/reference version.
Applying the rules preserves the semantics of the original program.

RULE 1
x = y ; z = x op E  where op is an operator and E is an expression does not contain x 
==> z = y op E ; x = y

RULE 2
x = y ; z = E  where E does not contain x 
==> z = E ; x = y

RULE 3
x = k ; z = x op E  where k is a constant and op is an operator and E in an expression
==>  x = k ; z = k op E


Now I am going to paste 3 variants of the same python function.
Please, strictly apply these rules and tell me whether the resulting programs are semantically equivalent to the reference version or not.
